## The Challenge

In honour of this theme, R-Ladies Ottawa is hosting another data challenge!

![CHALLENGE POSTER HERE](images/data_challenge_2025.svg)

This theme invites us to think about how far we have come and how far we have yet to go towards gender equality. For this challenge you are invited to use any longitudinal data source to create a visualization (ranging from a single plot to a full on shiny app) that shows how gender equality has evolved over time. 

This challenge is open ended and we strongly encourage creativity! However, here are a few samples to get you started:

### 1. Labour force participation by gender
  
  Create a plot showing how gender ratios in the labour force has changed over time: [Labour force characteristics by age group, monthly, seasonally adjusted](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410028702&pickMembers%5B0%5D=1.1&pickMembers%5B1%5D=3.3&cubeTimeFrame.startMonth=09&cubeTimeFrame.startYear=2023&referencePeriods=20230901%2C20230901)

### 2. Post-secondary education by gender

  Investigate how gender equality in post-secondary education has changed over time: [Postsecondary enrolments, by registration status, institution type, status of student in Canada and gender](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3710001801)

## Guidelines

Although this challenge is hosted by *R-Ladies* Ottawa, you don't have to use R to participate. You could use R, Python, a combination of the two, or anything you're comfortable with! 

No previous programming experience is required! If you're interested in participating, but aren't sure where to start, check out the recordings from our [Introduction to R workshops](https://rladies-ottawa.gitub.io/events/2024/intro_to_r.html) that we hosted in early 2024. The workshops will give you a solid foundation in data analysis and data visualization using R.

While anyone is welcome to participate in the challenge and submit an entry, **only submissions by women and gender minorities who reside in Canada will be eligible for the prizes.**

You can participate individually, or in teams of up to 5 people!

## Prizes

All participants will receive HexStickers! The most creative solution (selected by the R-Ladies Ottawa organizing team) will receive a $25 gift card to [Maker House](https://makerhouse.com/)!

## How to submit an entry

This will be a month-long data challenge, and you'll have until **April 4th** to submit your entry. Your submission can be in any form you like -- it can be a Quarto document, an image, a link to a webpage, or a link to a video, for example.

There are two options for submitting an entry: 

* Option 1 (preferred option): If you have experience with GitHub and Quarto, you can create a pull request on [this repository](https://github.com/RLadies-Ottawa/rladies-ottawa.github.io) and add your submission to the ["Submissions"](iwd.qmd#submissions) part of this page
* Option 2: If you don't have experience with GitHub, you can email ottawa@rladies.org a link to your submission materials and we will add the link to the ["Submissions"](iwd.qmd#submissions) part of this page

## Showcasing your analysis

After the submission deadline, R-Ladies Ottawa will host a virtual event where participants can showcase their work. This is a great way to learn from one another and to connect with other like-minded individuals!

The date and time of the showcase event will be announced soon.

## Submissions

Stay tuned!
