## About R-Ladies

[R-Ladies](https://www.rladies.org) is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community. The R community suffers from an under-representation of minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) in every role and area of participation, whether as leaders, package developers, conference speakers, conference participants, educators, or users.

This website is for the Ottawa chapter of R-Ladies. The Ottawa chapter was founded in 2018. After the pandemic, R-Ladies Ottawa "rebooted" in September 2023. Today, the Ottawa chapter has `r num_members` members on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-ottawa/)!

## Important

**Please note that the mission of R-Ladies is to increase gender diversity in the R community.** While our Meetup Group is open to anyone to join, our events are intended to provide a safe space for women and gender minorities. Male allies may attend our in-person events **if they are invited by and accompanied by a woman or gender minority.**

:::

The best way to keep up to date with our upcoming events is to join [our Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-ottawa/). We post announcements regularly here!

If you are a woman or gender minority, we also recommend joining the [global R-Ladies directory](https://www.rladies.org/directory/) and the [R-Ladies Community Slack](https://guide.rladies.org/comm/slack/). This is a great way to connect with R-Ladies from other chapters!

If you're interested in being an organizer for R-Ladies Ottawa, please contact us through a direct message on our Meetup.
