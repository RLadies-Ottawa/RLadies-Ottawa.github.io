In this presentation, Haddad highlighted the importance of building a compelling porfolio that not only highlights your skills, but also explains your professional identity.\nFor this year‚Äôs data challenge, we encourage you to find YOUR passion project to round out your portfolio and develop your professional story! Take a look at your GitHub profile and ask yourself, what type of project is missing here?\nFor example, if you participated in last year‚Äôs challenge and created a traditional plot of some sort, this year try creating a visualization using a table, dashboard or another-outside-the-box presentation tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more inspo, be sure to check out our March 2025 event Coding for a Cause with Claudie Larouche!\n\n\n\nCheck out Haddad‚Äôs presentation below:",

Our project aims to explore women‚Äôs contributions in data science, investigate global research content, and examine advancements in women‚Äôs health research investments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Objectives\n\nAnalyzing Women‚Äôs Contributions in Data Science Research\n\nIdentify authors of research papers in data science and assess the significance of women‚Äôs contributions.\nInvestigate the distribution of research publications conducted by women per country, considering the population size of each country.\n\nInvestigating Research on Women‚Äôs Health\n\nAnalyze the distribution of research publications on women‚Äôs health per country.\nIdentify trends in research papers related to women‚Äôs health.\n\n\n\n\nMain Steps\n\nDefining Relevant Keywords\n\n\nIdentified keywords related to data science and data technologies for the first objective.\nIdentified keywords related to women‚Äôs health for the second objective.\n\n\nData Extraction from PubMed\n\n\nFocused on extracting data concerning the first author of the publication from PubMed.\n\n\nGender Detection Using APIs\n\n\nUtilized APIs to detect the gender of the first author by their name.\n\n\nCountry Extraction Algorithm Developed an algorithm and utilized other sources to extract the most likely and relevant country from the given affiliation in PubMed data.\nData Enhancement\n\n\nEnhanced the dataset by incorporating additional information such as population and employment ratio.\n\n\nContent Analysis\n\n\nAnalyzed content based on keywords of the articles.\n\n\nDynamic Analysis and Visualization\n\n\nPerformed dynamic analysis and visualization to provide insights into publication details and countries on a map.\n\n\nDeployment\n\n\nDeployed the Shiny app using rsconnect (utilizing the free plan of shinyapps.io which permits 25 active hours per month).\n\n\n\nShiny App\nWe have developed a Shiny app to showcase our analysis and insights. The app dynamically presents details of publications, countries involved, and thematic analysis. You can access the app https://islemmeh.shinyapps.io/shinyappmapsearch/.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur project involved a systematic approach, from data extraction to analysis and visualization, providing valuable insights into women‚Äôs contributions to data science research and investments in women‚Äôs health. We are confident that our idea can be further evolved, particularly through future optimizations, additional data gathering, and in-depth content and correlation analysis.This project contributes to ongoing efforts to advance the theme of investing in women and accelerating progress in these critical areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNyamekye Asare\nI took on this new challenge to build a dashboard based on ‚Äúflexdashboard‚Äù.
